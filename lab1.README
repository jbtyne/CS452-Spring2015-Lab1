Description: 
At the beginning, a blank white canvas appears. The user must first click on the canvas to 
display a shape. The first shape is a red square. Upon a second click, a red triangle replaces the square. 
On a third click, a red rhombus replaces the triangle. A fourth click will return to the square and 
successive clicks will continue to cycle through the three shapes.
